# NIH postbac position: Deep learning for biological electron microscopy
The [Laboratory of Cellular Imaging and Macromolecular Biophysics](https://www.nibib.nih.gov/labs-at-nibib/laboratory-cellular-imaging-and-macromolecular-biophysics-lcimb) (LCIMB) is seeking applications for [Postbaccalaureate intramural research training awards](https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/postbac_irta) (Postbac IRTAs) for a project developing computer vision tools for biological electron microscopy. Postbac IRTAs are for recent graduates who intend to apply to graduate or professional school, but wish to first spend 1-2 years doing research at the NIH.

We are looking for applicants with strong math, programming, and/or data science backgrounds to help build software tools to analyze large 3D images of biological tissue at nanoscale resolution. A biological background is helpful but not essential. Our current challenge is automating image segmentation. Effective automation requires new, high-performing machine learning algorithms and a data processing pipeline that can handle large datasets. We are using Python and TensorFlow to develop tools which run on workstations as well as NIH's Biowulf computing cluster.

### Location
Bethesda, MD

### Duration
Negotiable. 12-24 months, beginning in summer or fall 2018.

### Eligibility
The Postbac IRTA program is intended for recent bachelor's and master's degree recipients who intend to apply to graduate or professional school. This program is open only to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. [Check here](https://www.training.nih.gov/resources/faqs/postbac_irta#Eligibility) to see if you are eligible for this position.

### Duties
Accepted postbacs will do some or all of the following:
* Become familiar with microscopy techniques used in LCIMB.
* Gain proficiency in the theory and practice of deep learning for computer vision. This includes reading and making use of recent papers in the academic machine learning literature.
* Use TensorFlow and Python to design, train, and use neural networks for 3D image segmentation.
* Design workflows which use neural networks to segment electron microscopy images, and optimize those workflows to scale to very large datasets.

### Required skills
Successful applicants will have most or all of these skills:
* A mathematical background including linear algebra, ODEs, and multivariable calculus.
* Proficiency in Python, or proficiency in another programming language and a willingness to learn Python.
* Experience with modern machine learning techniques, especially deep neural networks.
* Ability to communicate the methods and results of our computational work to scientists who may not have computational expertise.

### Preferred skills
Preference may be given to applicants with one or more of these skills:
* Familarity with Linux, command line interfaces, and git/GitHub.
* A mathematical background including higher math topics like numerical analysis, optimization, or mathematical signal processing.
* Experience with programming for scientific computing or data science, especially in Python.
* Experience with deep learning libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, or PyTorch.
* Experience deploying code on computing clusters.
