# Jobs and internships in machine learning at the NIH
Machine learning techniques promise to revolutionize our ability to analyze the enormous quantities of data generated in the course of biomedical research. Labs at the NIH are working to develop the software tools to realize that promise, and we are looking for students with strong math, computer science, and data science backgrounds to join us in multiple roles.
